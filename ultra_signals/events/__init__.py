"""Events subsystem (Sprint 28).

Provides:
 - Provider interfaces for external economic / crypto incident calendars.
 - Local SQLite backed event store.
 - Classification + gating logic to veto / dampen trades around high-impact events.

Initial lightweight implementation â€“ providers are stubs returning empty lists
until real data sources are wired. Gating + store + config schema are functional
so backtest / live engine can already integrate observe-only mode.
