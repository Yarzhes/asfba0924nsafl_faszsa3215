"""Drift monitoring helpers for Sprint 60.

This package contains small, well-tested primitives used by the drift
monitoring service: sequential statistical tests (SPRT, CUSUM), a
lightweight policy engine and retrain job spec emitter.

The implementation is intentionally compact and dependency-free so it can
be imported safely from live pipelines and unit-tested in CI.
