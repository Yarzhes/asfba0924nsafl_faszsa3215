# S5-T5: Dynamic Universe Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-08-22
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

This document defines the policy for constructing and maintaining the dynamic tradable universe. The policy outlines the process of filtering and combining Relative Strength (RS) scores with other data points to create a robust and liquid set of assets for trading.

## 2. Universe Construction Policy

This section details the step-by-step process for creating the final tradable universe from the initial RS lists.

### 2.1. Initial Lists

The process begins with the `Top-K Longs` and `Bottom-K Shorts` lists generated by the Relative Strength (RS) module, where `K` is a configurable parameter (e.g., K=100). These lists represent the assets with the highest and lowest momentum, respectively.

### 2.2. Liquidity Gate

This gate ensures that only assets with sufficient liquidity are included in the final universe.

- **Rule:** An asset must have a 24-hour rolling volume of at least **$10,000,000 USD**.
- **Action:** Assets that fail to meet this threshold are removed from the `Top-K` and `Bottom-K` lists for the current rebalance period.

### 2.3. Spread Gate

This gate removes assets with excessively wide bid-ask spreads, which can lead to high transaction costs and poor execution.

- **Rule:** The bid-ask spread must not exceed **0.10%** (10 basis points) of the mid-price.
- **Formula:** `(Ask - Bid) / Mid-Price <= 0.0010`
- **Action:** Assets that breach this spread threshold are removed from the lists for the current rebalance period.

## 3. Refresh Schedule

This section defines the cadence for rebuilding the tradable universe.

- **Frequency:** The entire tradable universe shall be rebuilt every **24 hours**.
- **Timing:** The process will run at **00:00 UTC**, aligned with the daily candle close and the RS module's rebalance schedule. This ensures that the universe is based on the most recent complete data.

## 4. Hysteresis Mechanism

This policy is designed to reduce portfolio churn by requiring a sustained signal before an asset is added to or removed from the tradable universe. This prevents "flapping" where assets enter and exit the list based on short-term noise.

- **Entry Rule:** An asset must appear in the post-filter (Liquidity and Spread gates) `Top-K` or `Bottom-K` list for **two consecutive** rebalance periods to be included in the official tradable universe.
- **Exit Rule:** An asset currently in the tradable universe must fail to appear in the post-filter `Top-K` or `Bottom-K` list for **two consecutive** rebalance periods to be removed.

## 5. Examples

This section provides practical examples illustrating how the filtering gates and hysteresis mechanism work.

### 5.1. Example: Filtering Gates

Assume the `Top-3 Longs` list from the RS module on Day `T` is: `[Asset A, Asset B, Asset C]`.

| Asset | 24hr Volume | Bid | Ask | Mid-Price | Spread % | Liquidity Filter | Spread Filter | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Asset A | $15,000,000 | 100.00 | 100.05 | 100.025 | 0.05% | **PASS** | **PASS** | `PASS` |
| Asset B | $8,000,000 | 200.00 | 200.10 | 200.05 | 0.05% | **FAIL** | **PASS** | `FAIL` |
| Asset C | $20,000,000 | 300.00 | 300.35 | 300.175 | 0.12% | **PASS** | **FAIL** | `FAIL` |

After applying the gates, the filtered `Top-3 Longs` list for Day `T` is `[Asset A]`.

### 5.2. Example: Hysteresis Mechanism

This example shows how the entry and exit rules are applied over four consecutive rebalance periods (`T`, `T+1`, `T+2`, `T+3`).

**Scenario: Asset Entry**

- **Asset X** appears in the post-filter `Top-K` list.
- **Day T:** Asset X is in `Top-K`. `Tradable = NO` (Needs 2 consecutive signals)
- **Day T+1:** Asset X is in `Top-K`. `Tradable = YES` (Entry condition met)
- **Day T+2:** Asset X is in `Top-K`. `Tradable = YES` (Remains in universe)

**Scenario: Asset Exit**

- **Asset Y** is currently in the tradable universe.
- **Day T:** Asset Y is in `Top-K`. `Tradable = YES` (Remains in universe)
- **Day T+1:** Asset Y is **NOT** in `Top-K`. `Tradable = YES` (Needs 2 consecutive failures to exit)
- **Day T+2:** Asset Y is **NOT** in `Top-K`. `Tradable = NO` (Exit condition met)
- **Day T+3:** Asset Y is in `Top-K`. `Tradable = NO` (Must re-qualify for entry)
